## Course Overview

In this course, we examined the fundamentals of Informatics as a cross-disciplinary domain, focusing on concepts like information, technology, knowledge, and modeling. The course explored how these ideas impact scientific progress and societal well-being, emphasizing the role of computational and systems thinking in advancing science and societal outcomes.

## Assignments

This repository includes homework files that demonstrate the progression of skills developed through each assignment. These assignments were designed to build foundational knowledge in Python, machine learning, and analytical techniques as we advanced toward mastering these critical areas.

## Project Title

**Evaluating a Multitude of Factors to Uncover Patterns and Prevalence in Brain Strokes**

## Project Scope

Brain strokes, caused by an interruption in blood supply to the brain, are a significant health issue influenced by chronic conditions such as hypertension and structural abnormalities, as well as lifestyle factors including smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity. Given that strokes are a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, a comprehensive approach is essential for understanding their risk factors.

## Aim

The project aims to analyze a dataset of 4,981 entries to identify patterns and assess the prevalence of brain strokes. It investigates how variables such as gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, marital status, work type, residence type, average glucose level, BMI, and smoking status correlate with stroke occurrence.

## Research Question

How do these variables correlate with the occurrence of a brain stroke?

## Hypotheses

- **Null Hypothesis (H0):** There is no association between the variables and the occurrence of a brain stroke.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** There is an association between the variables and the occurrence of a brain stroke.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to uncover patterns and assess stroke prevalence across different demographics. The insights gained will contribute to the development of targeted preventive strategies and healthcare policies to enhance public health.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection and Cleaning:** Gathered and ensured the accuracy of data on stroke risk factors.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzed data distributions and identified outliers.
3. **Statistical Testing:** Applied methods such as the Chi-square test and Kruskal-Wallis Test to examine variable relationships.
4. **Correlation Analysis:** Explored relationships between health and lifestyle variables and stroke risk.
5. **Predictive Modeling and Machine Learning:** Developed and evaluated models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost to predict stroke risk.
6. **Model Evaluation:** Used metrics such as ROC curves to assess model effectiveness.

This methodology provides a comprehensive understanding of factors contributing to brain strokes, employing both statistical and machine learning techniques for insightful analysis.

## Data Collection and Source

The analysis is based on a detailed dataset from Kaggle, which includes various factors such as gender, age, blood pressure condition, heart health, marital status, employment, living environment, sugar levels in blood, body weight index, smoking habits, and records of stroke occurrences. The dataset can be accessed at [Kaggle - Brain Stroke Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jillanisofttech/brain-stroke-dataset/).
